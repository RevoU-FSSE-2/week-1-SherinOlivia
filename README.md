# Hi!
## My name is Sherin Olivia 
## This file is dedicated as part of the first week project involving git, html, css, and javascript

### Self-note : 
- main content with picture and brief self-intro 
- nav links (ig, linkedin, project site through netlify)
- change the colours cause basic doesn't define me.

I may not bite but curiousity may or may not kill the cat~

#### Disclaimer : I go by Roo online! so yep. If you see any wild Roo online, that could be me. :>
